# finished-gTasks-reporter
Short script for reporting finished tasks (from Google Tasks) in the last couple of days.

## Description
The code is based on the "quickstart.py" from the [Google Tasks API-Dokumentations](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/tasks/quickstart/python).
My goal was to have a nice little report of the thing's I finished the the last couple of days.
because from my point of view there's a lack of "easy" possible ways (e.g. via apps) to take a look on finished tasks. I think that could be helpful even as a feedback for somebody's self-assurance to get a feeling especially for the time with many personal/private project's (without the need of charging anyone for the time I spend).
